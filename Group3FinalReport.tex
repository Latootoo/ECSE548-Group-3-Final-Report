% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:

%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better

%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***

Two 4-bits unsigned multiplier are designed and implemented for comparison purposes. The array multiplier and the Booth encoding Radix-4 multiplier were designed and implemented in Electric. The criterion for evaluation included delay analysis, power comsumption and layout size of the implementations. IRSIM was the simulation software used for delay and power simulations and the Electric layout implementations were used for size comparison.

\section{Introduction}
Hardware multiplication can be implemented in many different ways. Each of the different algorithms have its own advantages and draw back in term of the VLSI design. A way to compare the different kinds of multiplication algorithm is to implement them in layout using CAD tools such as Electric and then use simulation softwares to evaluate their performance. For simplicity's sake, two 4-bits unsigned multipliers are compared and evaluated in the scope of this project. The goal is to determine if the Radix-4 Booth multiplier has a sizeable advantage over the simple array multiplier.

\subsection{Booth Algorithm}
The idea is to reduce the number of partial products by half, by using the technique of radix 4 Booth recoding​. Instead of shifting and adding for every column of the multiplier term and multiplying by 1 or 0, we only take every second column, and multiply by ±1, ±2, or 0, to obtain the same results. ​\\

\begin{tabular}{ l c r }
Booth&\\
PP0 = Multiplicand * -1, shifted left 0 bits (x-1)​\\
PP1 = Multiplicand * 2, shifted left 2 bits (x 8)​\\
\\
Array&\\
PP0 = Multiplicand * 1, shifted left 0 bits (x 1)​\\
PP1 = Multiplicand * 1, shifted left 1 bits (x 2)​\\
PP2 = Multiplicand * 1, shifted left 2 bits (x 4)​\\
PP3 = Multiplicand * 0, shifted left 3 bits (x 0)\\
\end{tabular}
\\
\\
To Booth recode the multiplier term, we consider the bits in blocks of three, such that each block overlaps the previous block by one bit. 

\subsection{Encoder Design}

At the beginning of our design, a preliminary schematic of our multiplier was drawn based on the calculation example. The encoder cells for each partial product and selector cell are designed based on the Booth’s multiplication algorithm introduced in CMOS VLSI design [1]. The 8-bit binary adder are provided in standard cell library wordlib8.

% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

The encoder cells produce control signals SINGLE, DOUBLE and NEG to indicate the value of each partial product. Partial product PP2 is a special case that only have two possible value: 0 and Y. Therefore, the PP2 encoder and selector is implemented using AND gates in high-level schematic.

\subsection{Sign extension and 2’s complement}
In order to produce the correct answer, each partial product from previous stage needs to be shifted by certain amount and assigned with corresponding sign extension. The addition of 1 for negative partial products is implemented in the next partial product. The bitwise implementation for each partial product is shown in the table below. NEG0 and NEG1 correspond to the NEG control signal from Booth encoders.

\subsection{Performance Evaluation}
As a metric to compare the array and Booth multiplier, the power, area and delay of both implementation were analyzed. A stronger emphasis was given for timing measurement since we evaluated that the main drawback of an array multiplier is its long critical path, which has a stronger influence on the propagation delay difference. The testing simulations for power and delay were performed using IRSIM, a tool for simulating digital circuits. [2] “It is a "switch-level" simulator; that is, it treats transistors as ideal switches. Extracted capacitance and lumped resistance values are used to make the switch a little bit more realistic than the ideal, using the RC time constants to predict the relative timing of events.” In these simulations we have used Vdd= 5V and f=1MHz frequency operation. 

\subsection{Area}
For the area measurement, the Electric VLSI designs system software was used to count the number of transistors as well as to evaluate the width and height of the layouts. As observed in Table 1, the Booth multiplier has a lower number of transistors but covers a larger space area than the array multiplier. This can be explained by how the array multiplier is structured, which can be easily compacted and optimized in space since it's composed of the same building structure: carry save adders. For Booth multiplier, as seen in Figure 9, it is more difficult to use similar tricks because of the way the encoders and booth selectors are placed. For example, the partial product 0 encoder on the left significantly increase the design width and leaves a lot of unused white space below it. Power rails, which are absent in the array design, also increase the area. A smaller Booth implementation is definitely possible and is subject to further optimizations if given more time.

\subsection{Timing}
For the delay, a testbench with every 8 bit input combinations (256 inputs) was tested to verify the design functionality. The file “testbench.cmd” in the deliverable presents the script used for the multipliers and without any issues, the outputs were exactly the same. After the functionality has been ensured, the delay from 00000000 to every single input was measured. Figure 10 shows the inputs x0, x1, x2 ,x3, y0, y1, y2, y3 and outputs p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7 were displayed with the delay displayed at the top. The “multiplier.xml” excel file presents the data and IRSIM delays generated.  As predicted, booth delay is faster, with an average delay and worst case delay of 15.133 ns, 23.08 ns and 20.047 ns, 29.76 ns respectively for Booth and array. This represents a 25.28% performance increase. As revealed in the critical path evaluation for the last partial product, P7, the 8 bit adders in the array multiplier has 17 steps whereas Booth has 13. The numerous carry save adders in the array are costly in time with approximately 0.6 ns delay each and in contrast, the transition for sign0 to 1 takes 7.365 ns which accounts for 24% of the Booth time and thus, the main source of bottleneck.

\subsection{Power}
An initial dynamic power estimation calculation was performed with Equation 1. An activity factor of 0.1 was used which is standard constant used for the fraction of the circuit that is switching, a supply voltage of 5V and clock frequency of 1 Mhz. The total nodal capacitance was found to be 33.61 pF and 28.87 pF for Booth and array respectively which gives a theoretical dynamic power of 0.0168 mW and 0.0144 mW. This is very close to the IRSIM power given at 0.0835 mW and 0.0297 mW, which considers transistors as ideal switches as mentioned earlier. As seen in Table 2, the Booth multiplier consumes much more power than array multiplier, 95.05% more than its counterpart. As observed in [3], the major sources of power dissipation in multipliers are spurious transitions and logic races that flow through the circuit. Thus, the glitches generated in the Booth multiplier makes this architecture more power consuming, which is captured with the IRSIM simulator.

\subsection{Test Simulation Analysis}
The method of Booth recording reduces the numbers of adders and hence the delay required to produce the partial sums by examining three bits at a time. The high performance of booth multiplier comes with the drawback of power consumption. The reason for this is the large number of adder cells that consume power. ​ For the array multiplier, it gives better power consumption as well as optimum number of components required, but delay for this multiplier is larger. It also requires larger number of gates because of which area is also increased; due to this array multiplier is less economical . Thus, it is a fast multiplier but hardware complexity is high.​

\section{Conclusion}
Comparison of the logic and electrical level estimates were done and support that the Booth radix-4 multiplier consumes more power and has less delay. If given more time, a sign extension corrector would have been added to our design to enhance the ability of the Booth multiplier to multiply not only the unsigned number but as well the signed number. Additionally, as originally planned in the project proposal, the three multipliers designs (Wallace and Dadda trees, and SFQ multiplier) would have been implemented to compare more implementations.
